Although a common ornamental houseplant and greenhouse favorite, the *Alocasia sanderiana* plant is
considered critically endangered its endemic area of the Northern Mindanao region in the Philippines.
There are quite a few cultivars of this plant available, common ones including the
*Alocasia x Amazonica* hybrid and *Alocasia "polly"* (a dwarf variety). While this plant is
considered quite fussy by some growers, it will produce beautiful waxy leaves under the right
conditions with well draining soil. Just keep in mind that its leaves will brown easily from low
humidity or high sunlight!
