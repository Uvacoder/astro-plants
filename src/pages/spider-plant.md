Spider plants are an extremely popular house plant today- they can withstand neglect as their thick
white roots store lots of nutrients and water. They are also great air purifiers- they were found to
reduce toxic formaldehyde in a room by 95% over a 24 hour period in a NASA study. Interestingly,
they have also been found to be a mild hallucinogenic for house cats, although harmless. Once root bound, they may produce small white flowers and asexual clones, which can be directly propagated into soil or water.
