*Ficus elastica* is an attractive houseplant most commonly found with dark green/burgundy leaves, but also in variegated cultivars like the painting above. In its natural habitat, the plant commonly grows into a tree at a height of around 30 to 40 meters tall, and its long, dangling aerial roots have even been used form living bridges in India. While you cannot expect to grow anything near in size at home, rubber plants still grow well in pots and can reach impressive heights if given substantial room and a well aerated potting mix. The plants are quite hardy and can tolerate some neglect, but they will thrive best under well lit conditions. Fun fact: while it is possible to use the sap of the plant to produce rubber, the Par√° rubber tree is the plant species of choice for the commercial cultivation of rubber.
