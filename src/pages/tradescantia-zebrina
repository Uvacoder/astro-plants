Well known for its hardiness and attractive sparkling foliage, the *Tradescantia zebrina* has a well earned popularity amongst houseplants enthusiasts. Although originally from Mexico, the plant can now be found growing in tropical regions everywhere around the world and has frequently become invasive when left unchecked. This makes it an excellent starter plant for learning propagation, as any runners or hanging vines can be clipped and placed in water or soil to form roots. The plant will tolerate lower light conditions, but will yield more vibrant foliage under bright, indirect light.
