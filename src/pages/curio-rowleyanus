Despite its succulent nature, *Curio rowleyanus* (commonly known as string of pearls) can be a rapidly growing plant. The plant does well with bright light, but may crisp up if left in direct sunlight all day. It is best to use well draining soil, and some collectors have found that the plant does best when bottom watering is used. Clippings can easily be taken from the vines and placed directly into soil, although proper rooting can take quite a few months.
