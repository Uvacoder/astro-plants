    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <div class="latin-name">
        Welcome to Spotted, a site about rad houseplants and how to care for them. 
        <br><br>
        This website is a personal project created by Jack Guinane and Ella Minicola. The original intent was to provide a simple blog that would allow us to share cool houseplants we spotted with each other. While on a walk through Grange Park, we decided that we also wanted to build a catalog of plants, each accompanied by a custom watercolor illustration. The final result was this website, developed over the summer of 2018.
