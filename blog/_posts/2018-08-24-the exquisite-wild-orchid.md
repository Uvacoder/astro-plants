I've always thought of orchids as a delicate plant, but it is quite common to find wild ones on craggy rock faces and in patches of grass in Victoria, in particular the type pictured above. But despite copious research, I have been unable to identify the specific name of the ones I'v been seeing everywhere. However, this search led me down an internet rabbit hole-  and I learned quite a bit about orchids along the way. 

## Orchids in Canada

To my suprise, orchids are actually native to Canada (and  the rest of the world) from coast to coast, even being found in Ontario. They are definetly not just a tropical plant- although some of the most exciting varieties are only found in hot climates

## The Singapore Orchid

The "Singapore Orchid" is an entire seperate class of orchids- fitting, as I've always associated the flower with Singapore. The countries [national flower](https://www.marinabaysands.com/singapore-visitors-guide/nature-and-outdoors/orchids-singapore-national-flower.html#H0XWs5UGzHoBBxKW.97) is a special orchid hybrid called Vanda Miss Joaquim, named after it's breeder. It was the world's first cultivated orchard hybrid.  

## Vanilla Orchids

There's been a lot of talk of vanilla in the media lately as supplies have increasingly failed to meet demands. But why is this such a difficult spice to produce? Because the vanilla bean is actually coming from the pod from the vanilla orchid flower, and the fresh pod actually has no flavour- until it is steamed and fermented in a labor intensive process.

It is an extrememly difficult plant to cultivate, requiring many years of growth before ready to cultivate, and can only be grown in a specific range of climate. In the right hands, it can be grown in a greenhouse.

But who knew this extraordinarily important flavour came from an orchid?

## Further Identification

Moth orchids are probably the class you are the most familiar as they are commonly sold at grocery stores. But there are hosts more of orchid species, as they are the largest family of flowering plants. If you are interested, here are a few good identification guides for reference:
