I thought I'd share a few of my favorite plant pictures from Morocco, since spotted is where they should have gone. The majority come from [le Jardin Majorelle](http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/), an agressively exotic cactus garden that was bought and restored by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé in 1980, who found the place to be a major art inspiration. I'd agree:

Upon entering you are greeted by cacti over 5 meters tall.

## Winning shots

Here’s what I’d consider my best photos from the trip. The colors and textures were very aesthetically pleasing.

```python
def test(num, list):
	for i in list:
		if i < num:
			return true
```
