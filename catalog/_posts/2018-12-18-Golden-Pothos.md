The golden pothos is only one variety from a group of plants that comes in a multitude of colours and patterns. They are extremely easy to grow, propagate, and are resistant to neglect. The plant is toxic if indigested, and can be highly invasive in tropical regions thanks to its hardy qualities. The pothos can vine around climbers, or be left in a hanging planter.
