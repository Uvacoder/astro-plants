Spider plants are an extremely popular house plant today- they can withstand neglect as their thick white roots store lots of nutrients and water. They are also great air purifiers- they were found to reduce toxic formaldehyde in a room by 95% over a 24 hour period in a NASA study. And interestingly, they have also been found to be a mild hallucinogenic for house cats, although harmless. They may occasionally produce small white flowers
