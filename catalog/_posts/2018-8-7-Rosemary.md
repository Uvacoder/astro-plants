Rosemary’s name originates from the Latin words ‘ros’ and ‘marinus,’ which translate to “dew of the sea.” Despite it’s appearance, the herb is actually from the mint family along with basil, oregano and others. It is important to regularly check soil dampness and water accordingly, as rosemary does not show signs of under watering without significant damage to the plant.
