Sage has long been used in cooking, herbal therapy and in spiritual rituals. The tradition of burning the herb has roots in First Nation and Egyptian heritage, and is typically used to cleanse a space or a person and ward off evil spirits. Its pleasant aroma makes it a common cosmetic ingredient and essential oil extract.
